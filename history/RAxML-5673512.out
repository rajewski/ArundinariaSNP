NOTE: Reduced alignment (with duplicates and gap-only sites/taxa removed) 
NOTE: was saved to: /bigdata/littlab/arajewski/Arundinaria/phylo/concatenated/GTRGI/Concatenated_ambig.afa.raxml.reduced.phy

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 40 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: GTR+FO+I+G4m
Alignment sites / patterns: 4903 / 40
Gaps: 0.00 %
Invariant sites: 99.20 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: ./Concatenated_ambig.afa.raxml.rba

* Estimated memory requirements                : 1 MB

* Recommended number of threads / MPI processes: 1

Please note that numbers given above are rough estimates only. 
Actual memory consumption and parallel performance on your system may differ!

Alignment can be successfully read by RAxML-NG.
