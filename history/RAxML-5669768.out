Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 40 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: GTR+FO+I+G4m
Alignment sites / patterns: 4903 / 40
Gaps: 0.00 %
Invariant sites: 99.20 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: ../Concatenated_ambig.afa.raxml.rba

* Estimated memory requirements                : 1 MB

* Recommended number of threads / MPI processes: 1

Please note that numbers given above are rough estimates only. 
Actual memory consumption and parallel performance on your system may differ!

Alignment can be successfully read by RAxML-NG.

RAxML-NG was called at 19-Aug-2019 13:55:47 as follows:

raxml-ng --all --msa Concatenated_ambig.afa.raxml.rba --model GTR+G+I --bs-trees autoMRE --seed 121787 --threads 7

Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search + bootstrapping (Felsenstein Bootstrap)
  start tree(s): random (10) + parsimony (10)
  bootstrap replicates: max: 1000 + bootstopping (autoMRE, cutoff: 0.030000)

  SIMD kernels: AVX2
  parallelization: PTHREADS (7 threads), thread pinning: OFF

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (GTR+G+I) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.

WARNING: You might be using too many threads (7) for your alignment with 40 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.


ERROR: Too few patterns per thread! RAxML-NG will terminate now to avoid wasting resources.
NOTE:  Please reduce the number of threads (see guidelines above).
NOTE:  This check can be disabled with the '--force' option.
