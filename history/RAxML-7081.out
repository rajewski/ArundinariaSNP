RAxML-NG was called at 29-Aug-2019 13:23:44 as follows:

raxml-ng --all --tree pars{25},rand{25} --msa ../Plastid_NoMissing_matK.phy --prefix ./Plastid_NoMissing_matK.phy --model GTR+G+I --outgroup P.edulis --seed 121787 --blopt nr_safe --threads 1

Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search + bootstrapping (Felsenstein Bootstrap)
  start tree(s): random (25) + parsimony (25)
  bootstrap replicates: max: 1000 + bootstopping (autoMRE, cutoff: 0.030000)
  random seed: 121787
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-SAFE)
  SIMD kernels: AVX2
  parallelization: NONE/sequential

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (GTR+G+I) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
