usage:   speedseq sv [options]

sv options:
         -B FILE  full BAM file(s) (comma separated) (required)
         -S FILE  split reads BAM file(s) (comma separated) (required)
         -D FILE  discordant reads BAM files(s) (comma separated) (required)
         -R FILE  indexed reference genome fasta file (required)
         -o STR   output prefix [fullBam.bam]
         -t INT   threads [1] 
         -x FILE  BED file to exclude
         -g       genotype SV breakends with svtyper
         -d       calculate read-depth with CNVnator
         -w INT   CNVnator window size [100]
         -A       annotate the vcf with VEP
         -P       output LUMPY probability curves in VCF
         -m INT   minimum sample weight for a call [4]
         -r FLOAT trim threshold [0]
         -T DIR   temp directory [./output_prefix.XXXXXXXXXXXX]
         -k       keep temporary files

global options:
         -K FILE  path to speedseq.config file (default: same directory as speedseq)
