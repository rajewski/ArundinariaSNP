Warning, you specified a working directory via "-w"
Keep in mind that RAxML only accepts absolute path names, not relative ones!

You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 55 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file plastid/Plastid_NoMissing.phy.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
