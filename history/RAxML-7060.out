NOTE: Binary MSA file already exists: ./Plastid_NoMissing_matK.phy.raxml.rba


WARNING: You might be using too many threads (4) for your alignment with 7 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.


ERROR: Too few patterns per thread! RAxML-NG will terminate now to avoid wasting resources.
NOTE:  Please reduce the number of threads (see guidelines above).
NOTE:  This check can be disabled with the '--force' option.
